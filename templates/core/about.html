    <pre><center>According to a small online survey conducted by us, we have found that most of the people face
    problems in planning trips properly within their budget. People also face problems with finding
    & finalizing places to visit and getting updated information on them. We also noticed that there is
    no such platform which takes advantage of resources and solutions that local/domestic tour
    operators provide.
    To solve these problems, we are proposing a solution where we help people plan and execute
    their trips & tours using our platform. Through this platform, we will provide users/travelers with
    auto-generated trip plans & packages provided by tour operators based on their inputs such as
    destination, budget and other personal preferences etc. We also provide business/corporate trip
    plans to companies. These trip plans will be customizable. We also plan to take advantage of
    existing local tour operators, by providing them a platform to list their trip plans & packages.
    These tour operators provide packages with properly planned trips, transportation,
    accommodation, dining and activities, which can be helpful in creating great experiences for
    travelers within their budget. Along with this we provide a platform to other businesses such as
    hotels, restaurants, museums, parks, accommodation providers etc. And recommend these places
    to our travelers on their trip.
